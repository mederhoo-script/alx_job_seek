The project is aimed at providing a user-friendly interface for both job seekers and employers. Job seekers can easily browse job listings, filter by categories, and apply for positions, while employers can post job vacancies, manage their listings, and review applicants. Whether you're a developer looking for a full-stack opportunity or a company needing to find the right talent, this platform simplifies the entire process.
